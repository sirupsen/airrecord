# 1.0.0

* 1.0.0 introduces breaking changes, including removing support for symbols and
  implementing associations as instance methods. To upgrade:
  1. Change snake-case symbols to their correct column names:
    `record["First Name"]` instead of `record[:first_name]`)
  2. Change your association calls to use instance methods instead of `[]`:
      ```ruby
      class Tea < Airrecord::Table
        has_many :brews, class: "Brew", column: "Brews"
      end
      tea[:brews] #=> Error, no longer supported
      tea.brews #=> [<Brew>, <Brew>] returns associated Brew instances
      tea["Brews"] #=> ["rec456", "rec789"] returns a raw Airtable field
      ```
  3. Dates that are formed `\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2}` are no longer auto-parsed. Define a helper instead.
* Automatically throttle client calls to Airtable's API limit of 5 requests per second.
* Fix sorting by multiple fields
* Report `User-Agent` as `Airrecord`.
